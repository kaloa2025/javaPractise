/*
You are given two positive integers a and b . In one move you can increase a by 1 (replace a with a+1). Your task is to find the minimum number 
of moves you need to do in order to make a divisible by b.
It is possible, that you have to make 0 moves, as a is already divisible by b. You have to answer t independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t the number of test cases. 
Then t test cases follow. The only line of the test case contains two integers a and b
Output
For each test case print the answer â€” the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make a  divisible by b
