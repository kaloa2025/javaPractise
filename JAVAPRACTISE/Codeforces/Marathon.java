You are given four distinct integers a, b, c, d.
Timur and three other people are running a marathon. The value a is the distance that Timur has run and b, c, d correspond to the distances the 
other three participants ran.
Output the number of participants in front of Timur.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t the number of test cases. The description of each test case consists of four distinct integers a,b,c,d
Output
For each test case, output a single integer â€” the number of participants in front of Timur.

Note
For the first test case, there are 2 people in front of Timur, specifically the participants who ran distances of 3 nd 4
. The other participant is not in front of Timur because he ran a shorter distance than Timur.

For the second test case, no one is in front of Timur, since he ran a distance of 10000
 while all others ran a distance of 0
, 1
, and 2
 respectively.

For the third test case, only the second person is in front of Timur, who ran a total distance of 600
 while Timur ran a distance of 500
.
